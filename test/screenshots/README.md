## Important Notes

- **Do not edit these files manually** - they are auto-generated by Playwright
- These screenshots are compared against during `npm run test:visual`
- Small pixel differences (up to 100 pixels) are tolerated for anti-aliasing
- Screenshots are taken using Chromium in a locally served VS Code Web instance via `@vscode/test-web` at `http://localhost:3000`
