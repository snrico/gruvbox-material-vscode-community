## Important Notes

- **Do not edit these files manually** - they are auto-generated by Playwright
- These screenshots are compared against during `npm run test:visual`
- Small pixel differences (up to 500 pixels) are tolerated for anti-aliasing
- Screenshots are taken using Chromium in VS Code Web via `@vscode/test-web`
- **Linux only**: Visual tests run on Linux in CI for consistency and cost efficiency
